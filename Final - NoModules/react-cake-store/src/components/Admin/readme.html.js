                       I worked on the project for about two months, and in the final mount I worked on it every day for about
                       10-18 hours a day (I swear it is true). I learned a lot mostly by doing and from the internet.
                       I feel like the project is still not perfect but I am going to be an exchange student so I dont have anymore time to
                       work on it, and I am sure it is in extremely high standards, with respect to the class.</h1>

                       to present this to him, because I fell that there is so much work in this project that it will not be possible
                       to go over it by him self. If I will be in US in few days, but I will be happy to arrange a Skype call to go over it and get feedback </h1>

                                   existing project.

                                   it just took some playing around with the code until it was
                                   connected and up and running. Also something that was really
                                   hard for me included understanding all the dependencies in the

                               backend. Also, I spent the first week or so planning how the
                               website should look and coming up with possible ideas to
                               incorporate in the website. Some of the ideas we did not end up
                               using, but overall we both learned a lot from this project and
                               also learned how to work together as a team to create a fully

                               <h5> we used many ways to protect our site:</h5>

                                       DDOS and DOS attackes - we added an npm package that limits
                                       the number of responses any computer will receive, there is
                                       more relevant details in the app.js in the backend file
                                   </li>
                                   <li>
                                       Helmet - this makes the backend avoid requests with known
                                       malicious headers{" "}
                                   </li>

                                       CSRF - we are using JWT tokens with expiration of 5 minutes,
                                       also in every click the user is making the token is verified
                                       and replaced with a new token, which make CSRF attacks very
                                       unlikely
                                   </li>

                                       We limited text areas, they can receive a maximum amount of
                                       characters, and no symbols are allowed (only digits and
                                       numbers){" "}
                                   </li>

                                       We are handling errors and error messages are limited with
                                       no information
                                   </li>

                                       Obviously the site is password protected, and so also the
                                       passwords are encrypted before entered to DB.
                                   </li>

                               REACT: We used and learned reactJS, this was a great choice,
                               although when we started we didnt know anything about react, we
                               went through the tutorials and learned it, and using React made
                               the development much easier and more enjoyable.
